Hello This is my project E-Plant-Seedling-Protecting-system made with laravel 8, jetstream integrated with telegram bot
Problem statement
-According to, Ethiopian Enviroment and forest research institute,
Ethiopia has pledged to restore 15 million hectars of land by 2030 under the bonn challenge.
-According  to, Green legacy initiative in Ethiopia, 
Ethiopia has planned to plant 20 billion plants in the next 4 years.
ï¼ƒ In this researchs and thoughts, we saw a gap of 
   lack of encourage of people to take of planted trees.
So, in our project, we tried to fill this gap using web, mobile app(for both android and ios) and telegram bot.

The Solution

-Our website and bot gives information for the planters, where could he/she get the plants that he/she needs.
-It gives a user identity for the planter
-Everybody can give a comment to the planter regarding to his plant   using his/her secret number 
- The system shows a leaderboard list of top planters, and gives a chance of getting an award and competition.
